<!-- # Abyss Calendar -->

A minimal desktop calendar themed around *Made in Abyss*, built using React and Tauri.

This project takes inspiration from the seven layers of the Abyss and represents each layer through a different background. The goal was to turn a simple calendar into a calm, atmospheric desktop experience while keeping the interface minimal and distraction-free.
